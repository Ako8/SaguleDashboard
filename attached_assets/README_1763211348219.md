- Quick actions

### 2. 📅 Booking Calendar
- Visual calendar with bookings
- Calendar sync with Airbnb, Booking.com
- Booking management

### 3. 🏘️ Properties Management
- Property CRUD operations
- Room management
- Photo uploads
- Amenities selection
- Location management

### 4. 👥 Guests Table

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Missing API Endpoints:
The current API is missing some endpoints that would be needed for a complete booking system:

**Critical Missing:**
- Booking/Reservation CRUD (`/api/Booking`)
- Guest Management CRUD (`/api/Guest`)

**Workarounds:**
1. **For Bookings:** Use Calendar Sync system or implement mock bookings
2. **For Guests:** Extract from Auth system or implement with local state

**Recommendation:** Add these endpoints to the backend for full functionality.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue:** "401 Unauthorized"
**Solution:** Check if JWT token is properly stored and sent in headers

**Issue:** "CORS Error"
**Solution:** Ensure backend has proper CORS configuration

**Issue:** "File upload fails"
**Solution:** Check Content-Type is multipart/form-data and entityId/entityType are in query params

**Issue:** "Calendar sync not working"
**Solution:** Verify iCal URL is valid and accessible, check CalendarSource enum value

**Issue:** "Payment creation fails"
**Solution:** Ensure all required query parameters are sent (amount, currency, returnUrl)
